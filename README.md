**ðŸš€ LLM Fine-Tuning for Dialogue Summarization**
This project fine-tunes a pre-trained Transformer-based language model (LLM) on multi-turn dialogue datasets to generate concise and context-aware summaries. It leverages Hugging Face's Transformers library for model training and evaluation.

**ðŸ§  Key Features**
Dialogue Summarization: Fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM on custom multi-turn conversation data.

Model Training: Used Hugging Face Trainer API with ROUGE and BLEU metrics for evaluation.

Data Preprocessing: Efficient handling of dialogue datasets with tokenization and attention masking.

Performance Comparison: Showcased improvements over baseline summarization models.
